                        <h1>I almost passed out</h1>
                        <p>I don't think I've ever eaten anything so good. Nope ! I have never</br>
                            eaten anything so good. First of all I think we can talk about the</br>
                            location of the restaurant which is juste wonderful. Yes you are not dreaming </br>
                            the restaurant is located under water which offers us a breathtaking view !</br>
                            The atmosphere is amazing, yes you can eat while watching the sharks swim. </br>
                            But this is nothing compared to what I am about to tell you. </br>
                            There are no staff! We order directly on the tables with integrated</br>
                            screens and a robot brings us the meal in less than a minute!!! Finally,</br>
                            the secret pill, when I ate it, my body shook and I felt a sensation</br>
                            never seen before. Yes I have never eaten anything as good as that.</br>
                            Despite its price of 100 euros it costs you, so go for it!!!</br>

                        <h1>The crocodile paw scared me !</h1>
                        <p>My wife and I, we were very impressed by these robots. They </br>
                            brought us the meal in 1 minute, which is very rewarding for a </br>
                            restaurant. My wife was very frightened by these sharks which </br>
                            circled around us while we were eating. Overall the restaurant is</br>
                            very well done, there is the corner for a drink, which has a very </br>
                            futuristic look and the place to eat which located under water. </br>
                            Personally, I really liked this view! But came the moment of the </br>
                            dish. I ordered the restaurant's specialty, that is to say the crocodile </br>
                            paw and I received a real crocodile paw! I was very dripped and </br>
                            scared but when I tasted it I had a taste orgasm, it was excellent. I </br>
                            don't give 5 stars because of the crocodile paw which was visually </br>
                            very disgusting. The prices of the specialties are very expensive but I highly recommend this restaurant.</br>
